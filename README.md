# umbrella
This package contains functions (and example data) that aid in evaluating the performance of a conservation reserve in protecting the suitable habitat of species of conservation interest.  This package was designed specifically to assess conservation reserves created for an umbrella species--hence the name.

**version 0.1.0**: Contains two functions (`sumRaster` and `simReserve`) and three example datasets (`demo.sdm`, `demo.rsv`, and `demo.msk`). Demo of package submitted as supplement to published manuscript.

Bug reports or suggestions for the `umbrella` package should be directed to <jason.d.carlisle@gmail.com>
