# umbrella
This package contains functions (and example data) that aid in evaluating the performance of a conservation reserve in protecting the suitable habitat of species of conservation interest.  This package was designed specifically to assess conservation reserves created for an umbrella species--hence the name.

**version 0.1.0**: Contains two functions (`sumRaster` and `simReserve`) and three example datasets (`demo.sdm`, `demo.rsv`, and `demo.msk`).

**Tutorial**: See [UmbrellaMethodsDemo.R](https://github.com/jcarlis3/umbrella/blob/master/UmbrellaMethodsDemo.R) in the top-level directory for a tutorial use of the package including example data.  This file was supplied as a supplement to a Carlisle et al. manuscript currently in review.

**Bugs**: Bug reports or suggestions for the `umbrella` package should be directed to <jason.d.carlisle@gmail.com>.
